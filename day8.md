📝 Training Day 8 Report
📅 Date: 3 July 2025


✅ Topic Covered
   Image Generation via APIs (Stability AI, Hugging Face), Prompt Storage, File Formats, Base64 Encoding

🧠 Summary
   Today we learned how to generate images from text prompts using APIs like Stability AI (Stable Diffusion) and Hugging Face (Diffusers). We also practiced saving prompts and generated images in different formats (.jpg, .png, .webp). Base64 encoding of image data was discussed for use in JSON and HTML contexts.

💡 Key Learnings
  How to connect to AI image generation APIs using API keys
  Difference between .jpg, .png, .webp
  Save image and prompt logs for traceability
  Convert image to Base64 for web-based embedding

🔍 Observation
Choosing a detailed and styled prompt yields better image quality. Keeping a log of used prompts helps in traceability and iterative improvement.


🧾 Conclusion
Today’s session was highly practical, showing us how to control image generation through APIs and code. We now understand how prompts, file formats, and base64 come together in real-world AI development.
