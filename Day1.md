Training Day 1 Report
Date: 23 June 2025

Introduction to Generative AI
On the first day of training, we were introduced to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Generative AI refers to a type of AI system that can create new content such as text, images, music, or code by learning patterns from large datasets.
Example:
ChatGPT can write essays, generate stories, answer questions, or create code. Similarly, DALL·E can create images from textual descriptions.

What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing precise and effective instructions (prompts) to guide generative AI models in producing accurate and relevant outputs. A well-designed prompt leads to better, more useful responses.
Example:
A prompt like "Write a formal email to a teacher requesting leave for a family function" is much clearer and more effective than a simple "Write an email."

Types of Prompts (with Examples)
Instructional Prompt
Description: Directly instructs the AI what to do.
Example: "Summarize this article in five points."

Role-Based Prompt
Description: Asks the AI to act in a specific role.
Example: "You are a nutritionist. Suggest a healthy breakfast plan for students."

Few-Shot Prompt
Description: Gives a few examples to demonstrate the expected pattern.
Example:
"Translate the following:
English: Good morning → Spanish: Buenos días
English: Thank you → Spanish: Gracias
English: I love you → Spanish: Te quiero"

Zero-Shot Prompt
Description: Provides no examples; relies on the model’s general knowledge.
Example: "Translate ‘Happy birthday’ to French."

Chain-of-Thought Prompt
Description: Encourages step-by-step logical reasoning.
Example: "If you have 12 apples and you give 5 to your friend, how many are left? Explain your steps."

Constraint-Based Prompt
Description: Adds rules or limits to the response.
Example: "Write a poem about rain using exactly 20 words."

Refining Prompt
Description: Helps to clarify or improve an answer by asking to revise or refine.
Example: "Rewrite the following paragraph to make it more formal and professional."

Pro Prompting Tips

Always keep prompts clear and specific.
Provide background or context when needed.
Mention format if required (bullet points, paragraph, table, etc.)
Give examples for more precise outputs (few-shot).
Break large tasks into smaller, simpler instructions.
Add constraints on length, style, or content if needed.
Refine prompts after reviewing initial outputs to improve results.

Common Prompting Mistake

Writing vague or unclear prompts.
Mixing multiple questions in one prompt without clarity.
Giving conflicting or incomplete instructions.
Assuming the AI knows extra context not given in the prompt.
Not specifying tone, style, or depth of detail.
Overcomplicating the prompt with unnecessary details.
Forgetting to review and adjust after the first output.
