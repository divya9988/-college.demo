🧠 Prompt Engineering – The Art of Asking the Right Way
On Day 4, we learned about Prompt Engineering, which is the skill of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to get meaningful and accurate responses from LLMs. Writing a good prompt can drastically improve the performance and relevance of model outputs.

🧮 Prompt Formula
A helpful structure to build strong prompts:
mathematical
Prompt = Instruction + Context + Input Data + Output Format
Example:
"Summarize the following article (Instruction) about climate change (Context). The text is: [Input Data]. Return the summary in bullet points (Output Format)."

❌ Bad Prompt vs ✅ Good Prompt
Bad Prompt	Good Prompt
“Write email”	“Write a formal email requesting a meeting with the project manager tomorrow.”
“Explain AI”	“Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple terms for 10th-grade students.”
“Summarize text”	“Summarize the following news article in 3 bullet points with key takeaways.”


🧩 Activity Done in Class
Practiced creating prompts for tasks like summarization, coding, translation, and explanation.
Compared weak vs. well-structured prompts to see the difference in output.
Group activity: Wrote a prompt for a chatbot that helps students prepare for exams.


💡 Key Takeaways
Good prompts give clarity, context, and structure to the model.
Prompt engineering is like giving clear instructions to a smart assistant.
The better the prompt, the better the output.
Practiced using the Prompt Formula for different tasks and domains.
