🤖 Today’s Learning: AI Agents, Machine Learning Fundamentals, and Dataset Workflow

📌 Agents
I learned that Agents in AI are entities that perceive their environment through sensors and act upon it using actuators. In programming, an agent can be a software process that takes input, applies logic or learning, and produces intelligent output. Agents are the core of interactive AI systems.

📌 Machine Learning (ML)
I explored the structure of machine learning and its major branches:

🔹 RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback):
A learning process where an agent learns not only from environment rewards but also from human feedback to refine its performance.

🔹 SML (Supervised Machine Learning):
The most common ML approach where a model is trained using labeled datasets — each input has a known correct output.

🔹 USML (Unsupervised Machine Learning):
Learning from unlabeled data. The model tries to find patterns, groupings, or structure without predefined answers.

🔹 Supervised Machine Model:
This involves feeding a dataset with known inputs and outputs into a model that learns the mapping function between them.

📁 Dataset Preparation and CSV Creation
I practiced creating .csv (Comma-Separated Values) files to store structured data in tabular format. I learned how to load and prepare data for machine learning tasks using pandas and numpy.

✂️ Train-Test Split
I learned how to divide a dataset into training and testing parts using tools like train_test_split from scikit-learn. The training set is used to build the model, and the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

🛠️ Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning refers to training a pre-trained model further on a specific dataset to specialize it for a particular task. It improves performance by adapting existing knowledge to new data.

🧾 Train and Test JSON Files
I also learned how to prepare and structure .json files for storing training and testing data in key-value formats. This is especially useful for NLP and AI model fine-tuning.

🪛 Debugging: Buggy Code and Fixes
I worked with buggy code, identified logical and syntax errors, and practiced how to debug and correct the code. Fixing these issues helped me better understand how data flows through a machine learning pipeline.

✨ With all these tasks, I got a clearer understanding of the full ML workflow — from data preparation and modeling to testing and debugging.
