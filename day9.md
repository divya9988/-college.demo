Training day 9 Report
Date : 4 to 6 july 2025

üßë‚Äçüíª Today‚Äôs Learning:

I learned how to use Python to fetch content from college websites and summarize it in a detailed, word-by-word style like AI-generated text. This method helps in making complex website information clear and concise.

I also learned how to detect repeated questions in the content and categorize them into important groups such as Admissions, Exams, Courses, and Fees, to highlight key topics.

Additionally, I discovered how to store prompt templates or inputs in files, which makes managing and reusing prompts easier when working with AI or text processing tools. Along with that, I learned techniques to search specific words or terms inside the summary to quickly find important information.

All these skills came from my prompt engineering training, giving me a good understanding of how to structure prompts, process text data, and organize outputs efficiently. Although I have not built the full system yet, I now know the steps and components required.

‚ú® Looking forward to applying this knowledge practically soon!
