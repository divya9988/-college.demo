üåê Web Scraping, Summarization & Google AI Studio API Key Use    
   During these two days, we focused on the practical use of BeautifulSoup, working with HTML and Markdown, and summarizing content from websites. We also integrated Google AI Studio API keys for advanced tasks.

üîç Topics Covered
BeautifulSoup (Python Library)
Used for parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
Helpful for collecting titles, headings, paragraphs, links, etc.

HTML & Markdown Basics:
HTML: Core structure of web pages. We explored tags like <a>, <div>, <h1> to <h6>, <p>, etc.
Markdown: Lightweight formatting language for clean, readable documents and GitHub READMEs.


Activity: Website Summarization
1.Selected any live website.
2.Used Python and BeautifulSoup to:
    *Extract headings and content.
    *Identify and display internal and external links.
3.Summarized content using a pre-trained model or simple text summarization script.


Google AI Studio API Key:
Setup and configuration for access.
Enabled us to connect AI models for tasks like summarization or Q&A using Google Gemini.
Understood how API keys allow authentication for secure access.
