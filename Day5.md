Training Day 5 Report
Date: 27–29 June 2025


🤖 Hands-on Practice with Different AI Models
Over these three days, we engaged in hands-on activities exploring multiple advanced AI tools and language models. Each of these models offers unique capabilities, and we compared them in both functionality and performance.

🧪 AI Models Explored
ChatGPT (OpenAI)
Used for chatting, writing, code generation, explanations.

Gemini (Google)
Fast response, good with context-aware tasks and document analysis.

Grok (xAI)
Focused on real-time, witty responses with personality, mostly integrated in social platforms.

Claude 3 (Anthropic)
Powerful for reasoning, long-context processing, and safety-aligned outputs.

LLaMA 3 (Meta)
Open-source LLM, used for multilingual support and offline deployment.

DeepSeek
Specialized in coding, precise and helpful in giving coding suggestions.

DALL·E (OpenAI)
Image generation model: we gave it prompts to visualize concepts.

GitHub Copilot
Used inside code editors; generates real-time coding suggestions based on context.

🧑‍🏫 Classroom Discussions
We had group discussions about what we had learned the previous week. Everyone shared:
Their favorite model and why.
Differences in style, tone, and accuracy across platforms.
Challenges they faced with prompt crafting in different tools.
How multimodal models like DALL·E and Gemini handle visual + text data.

🎯 Key Takeaways
Each model has strengths:
➤ Claude 3 handles long inputs well.
➤ Copilot is great for developers.
➤ ChatGPT is flexible and consistent.
➤ DALL·E expands text into creative visuals.

Prompt engineering is essential across all tools.
AI models respond differently to the same prompt — understanding the model's behavior is important.
