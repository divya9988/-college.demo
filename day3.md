📘 Communication Tools & Project Coordination
    On the third day of training, we learned about professional communication platforms, task management tools, and collaboration systems used in modern software teams. These tools streamline teamwork and ensure accountability in project development cycles.

🧰 Tools and Platforms Introduced
Tool	Purpose/Use
Slack	Team communication and quick message sharing in organized channels.
Asana	Task assignment and tracking progress within teams.
Trello	Visual task board using cards and lists; ideal for simple workflows.
Jira	Advanced project tracking, mainly used in Agile and Scrum methodologies.

🔑 Other Key Concepts
API Key:
A secret authentication token used to access secured APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini).

Scrum Call:
A daily stand-up meeting (usually 15 mins) where team members briefly share:
What they did yesterday
What they plan to do today
Any blockers or issues they’re facing

🎤 Purpose: Keeps everyone updated and aligned during a sprint.

🧾 Examples: Good vs. Bad Prompt
