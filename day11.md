üó£Ô∏è Speech-to-Speech Conversion using Python and Gemini API:

Today, I learned how to perform speech-to-speech conversion using Python by combining speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis. This involves two key steps: first converting spoken audio into text, and then converting that text back into natural-sounding speech using AI.

To achieve this, I explored how to use Google Gemini API key to access powerful models for both transcription and speech generation. This API enables high-quality speech recognition and voice synthesis in multiple languages.

üì¶ Libraries and Packages Used:

In Python, I imported the following important libraries to support this task:

speech_recognition: for converting speech to text

gTTS or pyttsx3: for converting text back to speech

pydub or playsound: to play audio output

requests: to interact with the Gemini API

io, os: for file and audio handling

The process flow is:

Record or load an audio file as input.

Use the speech_recognition library to transcribe the speech into text.

Use the Gemini API or a text-to-speech engine to convert that text back into speech.

Play or store the final audio output.

This hands-on task helped me understand the real-time implementation of speech interfaces using AI and API services.

‚ú® With this, I‚Äôm building the base for developing AI-powered voice-based applications in the future.
